## Abstract {.page_break_before}

There must exist a finite set of fundamental operations that define the base of biochemical networks.
The composition of these operations present themselves as the seemingly infinite complexity of biological variety.
If we can determine this finite set of fundamental operations, we might be able to program biochemical networks like we currently program computers.
This paper presents a working theory unifying System F (or _second-order lambda calculus_) with biochemical constraints to build a theoretical framework for defining such a set of finite fundamental operations.
